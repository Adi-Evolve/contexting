# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do NOT create a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, report them privately by emailing: security@adi-evolve.dev

Provide:
- Affected component (e.g., chrome-extension, vscode-extension)
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept (if applicable)
- Your contact information for follow-up

We will respond within 72 hours.

## Supported Versions
We will provide security fixes for the latest release and the previous minor release.

## Data handling
All user data is stored locally by default. The project does not transmit user data to external servers unless explicitly configured by the user.

# VOID 2.5D Comic Experience Implementation Guide

## 1. UI Concept Overview
The VOID website has been transformed from a standard 3D scene into a **2.5D Interactive Comic Book**.
Instead of a heavy WebGL canvas, we use **CSS 3D Transforms** driven by scroll progress to simulate flipping pages.

**Key Features:**
- **Scroll-Driven Page Flips:** As the user scrolls down, the current "page" (section) rotates -180 degrees along its left spine, revealing the next page underneath.
- **Comic Aesthetics:** Halftone patterns, thick ink borders, hard shadows, and "speech bubble" layouts.
- **Interactive Elements:** Buttons with "POP!" onomatopoeia effects on hover.

## 2. Animation System Breakdown

### Scroll System (`usePageFlipScroll`)
- **Library:** `lenis` for smooth momentum scrolling.
- **Logic:**
  1.  We calculate the global scroll progress (0 to 1).
  2.  We map this progress to individual "page" progress (e.g., Page 0 flips from 0% to 25% of total scroll).
  3.  We update CSS Variables on the `<html>` root: `--page-angle-0`, `--page-angle-1`, etc.
  4.  These variables drive the `rotateY()` transform of the `PanelSection` components.

### Hover Effects
- **Technique:** Pure CSS transitions.
- **Effects:**
  - `scale(1.03)` for tactile feel.
  - `box-shadow` expansion for "lifting" the element.
  - `border-width` increase for "ink" effect.
  - **Onomatopoeia:** An SVG "POP!" element is conditionally rendered or toggled via CSS opacity on hover.

## 3. Component Architecture

### `PanelSection`
- **Role:** Acts as a single page in the comic book.
- **Props:** `index` (determines which scroll variable controls it).
- **Styling:** Uses `transform-style: preserve-3d` and `backface-visibility: hidden` to handle the flip mechanics.
- **Backface:** Includes a "VOID // PAGE X" watermark visible when the page is flipped.

### `ComicPanel`
- **Role:** Container for content within a page.
- **Variants:** `default`, `speech` (adds a tail), `thought`.

### `ComicTabs`
- **Role:** Fixed navigation on the right side.
- **Interaction:** Clicking a tab smooth-scrolls to the specific scroll position corresponding to that page's active state.

## 4. Accessibility & Motion Settings

### Reduced Motion
Users with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` should not see the large page flip animations.

**Implementation (CSS):**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .comicPage {
    transform: none !important;
    position: relative !important;
    opacity: 1 !important;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
  }
  /* Disable the fixed book layout and just stack them */
}
```

### Keyboard Navigation
- Focus rings have been styled with a thick `void-purple` outline to match the comic theme.
- `tabindex` flow follows the DOM order (Page 0 -> Page 1 -> ...), which matches the visual order before flipping.

## 5. Performance Guidelines

1.  **CSS Transforms:** We only animate `transform` and `opacity`. This keeps the animation on the GPU compositor thread.
2.  **Will-Change:** The `.comicPage` class uses `will-change: transform` to hint the browser to promote the layer.
3.  **Asset Size:** No large textures. The halftone pattern is a CSS radial gradient (very lightweight).
4.  **Lenis:** Configured with `smoothWheel: true` but standard easing to avoid "floaty" feeling.

## 6. Integration Steps

1.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install lenis` (already done).
2.  **Styles:** Ensure `globals.css` has the Tailwind setup.
3.  **Run:** `npm run dev`.

The system is designed to be "drop-in" compatible with the existing Next.js App Router structure.

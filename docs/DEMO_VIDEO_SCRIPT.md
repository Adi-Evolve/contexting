# 🎥 MemoryForge Demo Video Script

## 📋 Video Overview

**Duration**: 3-5 minutes  
**Target Audience**: Developers, AI enthusiasts, productivity users  
**Goal**: Show key features and "wow" moments that make MemoryForge unique

## 🎬 Scene-by-Scene Script

### Scene 1: Hook (0:00 - 0:20)

**Visual**: Animated title card → Quick montage of features  
**Voiceover**:

> "Your AI assistant forgets everything the moment you close the chat. But what if it could remember? What if it could connect ideas across time, understand cause and effect, and compress months of conversations into searchable memories?"

**Text Overlay**:
- "99.7% compression"
- "Semantic search"
- "Temporal graphs"
- "Zero dependencies"

### Scene 2: The Problem (0:20 - 0:45)

**Visual**: Split screen showing ChatGPT/Claude forgetting context  
**Voiceover**:

> "ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants have a critical flaw: they're stateless. Every conversation starts from scratch. You have to constantly repeat context, re-explain your project, and manually copy-paste previous conversations."

**Screen Recording**: 
1. Open ChatGPT
2. Ask: "What did we discuss yesterday?"
3. Show: "I don't have access to previous conversations"

### Scene 3: The Solution (0:45 - 1:10)

**Visual**: MemoryForge interface appearing  
**Voiceover**:

> "MemoryForge solves this. It's a local-first, universal memory system that works with any AI. Think of it as a second brain that remembers everything, compresses efficiently, and connects ideas automatically."
